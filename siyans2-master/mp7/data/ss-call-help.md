"HELP!!!" you yell. No response. Things are going from bad to worse. You begin to have a panic attack,
but then you hear a faint noise. Almost like a motor. It gets louder and louder, and you turn around to
see an apple, DRIVING towards you. The "car" parks in front of you and a man opens a slice to hop out.

"Hey there, buddy. Welcome to wherever the hell we are." he says as he walks towards you.

It was Steve Jobs! The one and only.

"Aren't you dead?" you ask, trying to get the obvious out of the way.

"Nope, Lebron just trapped me. He called me one day and asked for computer help, to which I gave a rather
nasty reply and hung up. Next time I see him he offers me a new drink he is sponsored by, and then I woke up
here." he replied, almost nonchalantly.

"Well, how do we get out?" you ask.

"I'm working on it. But now that I have an extra pair of hands, I think we can speed things along. Come with
me, and maybe we can get back to the real world." Jobs replies.

Do you go with Steve Jobs, or decide against it?

# ss-join-steve
You hop in the apple car with Steve

# ss-ignore-steve
You decide against it for no real reason
