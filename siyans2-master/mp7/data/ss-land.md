"Land?" you reply uncertainly.

Another montage ensues. You find yourself strapped into the gunner's seat of a tank
made out of a giant peach.

The tank rolls slowly but steadily to a large mountain. At the top you make out a small
structure.

"LOAD THE SHELLS!" Steve exclaims.

You slide a giant candy cane into the barrel and brace your ears. Steve pulls a lever,
and the cane is launched skyward, landing on the side of the mountain. With a shriek, the
Sugar Glider takes flight, landing on the tank, but right in front of the barrel.

"RELOAD!" Steve screams.

You fumble with the shell and slide it into the barrel. The front of the tank is being ripped to
shreds, until with a bang, the Sugar Glider was defeated.

"Good work!" Steve exclaims. "Lets get up to the top!"

At the top, you look around for the uranium. You find some eggs, and realize they are growing green.
Uranium! As you reach down you hear a shout.

"Hey you! Get me out of here!" you spin around and see a shoddy cage, with none other than
Albert Einstein inside!

"Thank god! Another human being!" Albert shouts. "That jerk Steve Jobs tricked me into coming up here
to get the uranium, but seeing as that damn bird is gone, I do hope we can get out of here."

(I have to study for an exam, so I'm gonna cut this short. Sry)

Long story short, you mix in the uranium and create the Cranberry Sprite. Everyone takes a sip
and next thing you know you, Steve Jobs, and Albert Einstein are all transported to your living room.
Lebron is imprisoned for kidnapping and you are hailed as a hero for saving two great minds.

THE END!
