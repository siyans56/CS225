"Air?" you reply uncertainly.

Another montage ensues. You find yourself strapped into the gunner's seat of a stealth bomber
made out of potato chip.

The plane soars slowly but steadily to a large mountain. At the top you make out a small
structure.

"FIRE MAIN CANNONS!" Steve exclaims.

You pull a trigger in front of you and the plane spews a stream of carrots at the mountains. With a shriek
the pterodactyl flies up and begins approaching the plane.

"RELOAD!" Steve screams.

You fumble with the carrot spool and slide it into the chamber. The pterodactyl starts
chomping off parts of a wing, until with a pull of the trigger, the Sugar Glider was defeated.

"Good work!" Steve exclaims. "Lets get up to the top!"

At the top, you look around for the uranium. You find some eggs, and realize they are growing green.
Uranium! As you reach down you hear a shout.

"Hey you! Get me out of here!" you spin around and see a shoddy cage, with none other than
Albert Einstein inside!

"Thank god! Another human being!" Albert shouts. "That jerk Steve Jobs tricked me into coming up here
to get the uranium, but seeing as that damn bird is gone, I do hope we can get out of here."

(I have to study for an exam, so I'm gonna cut this short. Sry)

Long story short, you mix in the uranium and create the Cranberry Sprite. Everyone takes a sip
and next thing you know you, Steve Jobs, and Albert Einstein are all transported to your living room.
Lebron is imprisoned for kidnapping and you are hailed as a hero for saving two great minds.

THE END!
