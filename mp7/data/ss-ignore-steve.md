"Um, no thanks Mr. Jobs" you reply.

"What? Why not?" he asks incredulously.

"Uhh, because." you reply, with no real reason.

after letting out a frustrated sigh, he hops back in his apple car and drives off.


You are left alone to consider why you just rejected the only salvation of escape. I mean really,
who doesn't want to go an adventure with Steve Jobs? Shame on you.

You spend the rest of your life in this edible world, slowly devouring it for food, until your appetite
sets about global warming and destroys this "planet". Way to go, fatty.
