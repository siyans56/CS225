The rocks are light and pretty spherical in shape. You realize they are actually jawbreakers that
Steve probably snacks on. With a handful of rocks you peer out your window and start aiming for the approaching
large flying dinosaur. It takes a couple of tosses to judge the distance, but miraculously, a jawbreaker lands
squarely in the "Sugar Glider's" mouth. It instinctively bites down on the foreign entity, promptly breaking
its jaw. In shock, the animal flies away.

"Great shot! Almost thought we wouldn't make it." Steve said.

The rest of the ride is nowhere near as exciting. The car rounds a bend and approaches a small cave.
You follow Steve inside and discover a cozy but rather advanced hideout filled with random electronics
and stuff.

"Wow," you exclaim. "Did you make all of this?" you ask.

"No," Steve replies sheepishly, "It turns out that the last Circuit City also got swallowed by Lebron's soda, so I just
grabbed all I could and brought it here. Welcome to the iHome!" Steve says proudly.

After settling in Steve let you in on his plan.

"My idea is simple. What got us here should get us out of here. And by that, I mean the Cranberry Sprite." he explains.
"Simply put, we need to recreate the recipe and consume it to teleport us back to the real world. Luckily, I was not too
fond of the drink and had a good amount in my mouth when I arrived here. I spit it in a convenient Ziploc bag I found
and analyzed the ingredients. I have everything I need, save for one ingredient. And that's where I need your help. You see,
the last ingredient is weapons-grade uranium. I actually sent someone else to go get it from the pterodactyl nest, and he succeeded
in getting in but was captured before he left. I fear the worst, but at any rate we'll need to retrieve the uranium."

Considering you had no ideas, you agree.

One gear-up montage later, and you look like a cool warrior ready to defeat the villain.

"So, land or air?" Steve asks.

"What?" you reply.

"You heard me; land or air?"

# ss-land
You choose land

# ss-air
You choose air
