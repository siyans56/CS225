It's a dark and snowy night in the suburbs. You're relatives and family are slowly streaming through the door
as your parents welcome them in for their annual holiday party. You smile and greet everyone, but you are shocked to see
Lebron James walk in, dressed festively in a Christmas sweater and towering over everyone else. No one else seems to react,
which leads you to believe that you are somehow related to the legend (why didn't your parents tell you??). Of course,
you are a huge fan, but you are almost scared to approach the absolute unit.

An hour passes and everyone is settled in. You search for LBJ and find him near the fireplace, slowly sipping a drink. You swallow
and approach him, until you stand below him and introduce yourself.

"H-Hey Lebron. Happy holidays." you say shyly.

"Hey man, happy holidays to you too. You must be Anne and Jared's kid." he says with a grin.

Before you respond, he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a soda can. A cranberry Spritie, to be exact.

"Hey, you want some Sprite? I got this new flavor that's supposed to be amazing! Not even released to the public yet!" Lebron asks.

You contemplate his offer...

# ss-accept
"Sure, sounds interesting" you reply, grabbing the soda can and popping the tab.

# ss-decline
"No thanks, I don't really drink soda." you politely respond.
