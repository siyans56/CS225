You drink the sprite. It tastes better than you've ever had in a can before. You take another sip, and then another,
and then another. You find that you cannot stop yourself from drinking. Lebron looks on, smiling almost in encouragement. The next
thing you know, the can is empty, and you stand there licking your lips.

"Have fun, kid!" Lebron exclaims, as he walks away and into another room. You try to call out to him to ask more questions, but
you find that you cannot move your mouth. In fact, you can't move at all, save for your tongue. You are scared and panicking, and
you try your hardest to regain control of your body. Finally, you move your eyes around, frantically searching for anyone to help.
You look down, and your eyes lock with the empty can in your hand at your side. You are fixated by the darkness inside, and all
of a sudden, you feel pulled towards it. Things get blurry and a forceful pull drags you inside the can, sucking you inside.

You awaken inside of what can only be explained as a detailed world akin to that of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Every normal
thing that you would see in the real world has been replaced with a food item of some sorts.

You try to get your bearing, as you stand up. You are unsure of what to do first.
